# heditor
A small and transparent editor

The opacity of the editor window can be adjusted. This means that you can type text in as you could enter text in an underlying Word document. For better understaning, please look at the screenshot in the images folder.

The editor has a popup menu from which the font type and size can be modified as well as it saves the text automatically in each 10 minutes. The file formats are plain text (.txt) and RichText (.rtf).

The software was built with Borland C++ XE3 using its embedded components. However, I uploaded the executable to the Win32/Release directory which contains all of the necessary libraries to run.
